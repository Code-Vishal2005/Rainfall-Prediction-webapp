## Overview

This project is a web application that predicts rainfall using advanced machine learning techniques. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment as a web app for user-friendly, real-time predictions.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- 📥 Gather historical weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- 🌐 Use sources like Kaggle, IMD (India Meteorological Department), or NOAA.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 🧹 Handle missing values and outliers.
- 🔢 Convert categorical data to numerical (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- 📏 Normalize or scale features for better model performance.

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 📊 Visualize data trends with line charts, histograms, scatter plots.
- 🔍 Identify correlations between features and rainfall.
- 🧠 Understand seasonal or regional patterns.

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- 🛠️ Create new features such as rolling averages, lag variables, and time-based indicators (month, season).
- 🧪 Select the most relevant features for prediction.

### 5️⃣ Model Selection & Training
- 🤖 Choose models like:
  - 🧮 Linear Regression
  - 🌳 Decision Trees
  - 🌲 Random Forest
  - ⚡ XGBoost
  - 🧠 LSTM (for time-series data)
- 🏋️‍♂️ Train models on the dataset.

### 6️⃣ Model Evaluation
- 📏 Evaluate with metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² Score.
- 🔁 Use cross-validation for robust performance.

### 7️⃣ Prediction
- 🌦️ Predict rainfall for future dates or unseen data.
- 📈 Visualize predictions vs actual values.

### 8️⃣ Deployment (Optional)
- 🌐 Web app built with Flask or Streamlit.
- 🚀 Deploy on platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS.
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface for input and output.

### 9️⃣ Documentation & Sharing
- 📝 Write a README (like this one!).
- 📤 Share your project on GitHub or Kaggle.
- 🎓 Add comments and explanations for reproducibility.
