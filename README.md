# Rainfall-Prediction-Webapp
🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using ML  🤖 Uses models like Linear Regression &amp; Random Forest  📊 Trained on historical weather data  ☁️ Forecasts future rainfall patterns  🔍 Accurate, data-driven insights  🌦️ #AI #MachineLearning #Weather  Let me know if you want to include specific libraries (like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc)

🪜 STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS FOR RAINFALL PREDICTIONS
1️⃣ DATA COLLECTION
📥 Gather historical weather data (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)

🌐 Use sources like Kaggle, IMD (India Meteorological Department), or NOAA

2️⃣ DATA CLEANING & PREPROCESSING
🧹 Handle missing values and outliers

🔢 Convert categorical data to numerical (e.g., one-hot encoding)

📏 Normalize or scale features for better model performance

3️⃣ EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
📊 Visualize data trends using plots (line charts, histograms, scatter plots)

🔍 Identify correlations between features and rainfall

🧠 Understand seasonal or regional patterns

4️⃣ FEATURE ENGINEERING
🛠️ Create new features like:

Rolling averages

Lag variables

Time-based indicators (month, season)

🧪 Select the most relevant features for prediction

5️⃣ MODEL SELECTION & TRAINING
🤖 Choose models like:

🧮 Linear Regression

🌳 Decision Trees

🌲 Random Forest

⚡ XGBoost

🧠 LSTM (for time series)

🏋️‍♂️ Train models using training dataset

6️⃣ MODEL EVALUATION
📏 Evaluate using metrics like:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

R² Score

🔁 Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness

7️⃣ PREDICTION
🌦️ Predict rainfall for future dates or unseen data

📈 Visualize predictions vs actual values

8️⃣ DEPLOYMENT (OPTIONAL)
🌐 Build a web app using Flask or Streamlit

🚀 Deploy on platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS

🖥️ Create a user-friendly interface for input and output

9️⃣ DOCUMENTATION & SHARING
📝 Write a README (like this one!)

📤 Share your project on GitHub or Kaggle

🎓 Add comments and explanations for reproducibility
